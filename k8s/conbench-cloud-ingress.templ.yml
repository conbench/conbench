  # Note(JP): we do not seem to use the k8s external DNS mechanism. Terraform
  # logic looks for the corresponding ingress object with the filter
  # `name=conbench-ingress`, and then updates DNS records (via Route 53) behind
  # the scenes to point to the load balancer (ALB) corresponding to this
  # ingress object. That is, the mapping between a specific DNS name and the
  # ALB happens in a different repository.

    # The ALB "idle timeout" Must be shorter than the TCP conn

    # also what is elsewhere called a "request timeout", ALB sends a 504
    # Gateway Timeout if the back-end does not return a response in this time
    # window. That is, let's pick this to be longer than the timeout constant
    # we use in reasonable clients. For example: client: 150 s, ALB idle
    # timeout: 160 s, gunicorn keepalive timeout: 170 s gunicorn worker
    # timeout: 180 s. Also see https://github.com/conbench/conbench/issues/1384
