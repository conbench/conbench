    Emit prepared query statement to database.

    Return a (df, dict) tuple. In the pandas DataFrame, each row represents a
    benchmark result (BMR) plus associated metadata (that cannot be typically
    found on the BenchmarkResult directly).

    A row in the dataframe contains limited information about a BMR, such as
    its ID. The dictionary mapping allows for looking up the full BMR via ID.

    Think: this function returns a timeseries: one BenchmarkResult(+additional
    info) per point in time, and the `BenchmarkResult(+additional info)` is
    spread across two objects.

    Note: this can be called on a query that returns results from multiple history
    fingerprints (hence grouping would be necessary later on when further processing
    this).

    Previously, we did

        df = pd.read_sql(statement, current_session.connection())

    It was not easily possible to access the raw BenchmarkResult object.

    This paradigm here does more explicit iteration and creates more
    intermediate objects, but also allows for more explicitly mapping items
    into the dataframe.

    If this fetches too many BMR columns, we can limit the columns fetched
    actively with a "deferred loading" technique provided by SQLAlchemy.

    Note that `row_iterator ` is an iterator that can only be consumed once,
    i.e. we immediately store the data in mappings.

    Assume that history is not gigantic; and even when history is comprised of

    df: pd.DataFrame, include_current_commit_in_rolling_stats: bool
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Add columns with rolling statistical information to a DataFrame of
    BenchmarkResults that represents historical data we're interested in.

    The input DataFrame must already have the following columns:

        - BenchmarkResult: history_fingerprint
        - BenchmarkResult: change_annotations
        - BenchmarkResult: svs (single value summary)
        - BenchmarkResult: result_timestamp
        - Commit: timestamp

    and this function will add these columns (more detail below):

        - begins_distribution_change (non-null bool, cleaned from change_annotations)
        - segment_id
        - rolling_mean_excluding_this_commit
        - rolling_mean
        - residual
        - rolling_stddev

    Let a "segment" of the matching BenchmarkResults be defined as all BenchmarkResults
    between two BenchmarkResults where ``begins_distribution_change`` is True (inclusive
    on the left, exclusive on the right). The notable stats of the distribution include:

        - ``rolling_mean`` - the rolling mean of the current segment (calculated using
          the mean of each BenchmarkResult). The maximum size of the window is
          ``Config.DISTRIBUTION_COMMITS`` (default 100 commits), but the left side of
          the window never goes beyond the start of the segment.
        - ``residual`` - the difference of the current BenchmarkResult's mean from the
          rolling mean.
        - ``rolling_stddev`` - the rolling standard deviation of the residuals. The
          maximum size of this window is also ``Config.DISTRIBUTION_COMMITS``, but it
          *can* go beyond the start of the segment, because we assume the spread of the
          distribution does not change enough among distributions to warrant throwing
          out data from older distributions.

    If ``include_current_commit_in_rolling_stats`` is True, when calculating
    ``rolling_mean`` and ``rolling_stddev``, the window will be inclusive on the right
    side. This is useful if you need to know the rolling stats as of each commit.

    If ``include_current_commit_in_rolling_stats`` is False, the window will be
    exclusive on the right side. This is useful if you want to compare each commit to
    the previous commit's rolling stats.
