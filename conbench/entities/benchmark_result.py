                Keys must be non-empty strings. Values should be non-empty
                strings.

                The special key "name" must be provided with a string value: it
                indicates the name of the conceptual benchmark that was
                performed for obtaining the result at hand. All case
                permutations of a conceptual benchmark by definition have this
                name in common.

                Example: a conceptual benchmark with name "foo-write-file"
                might have meaningful case permutations involving tag names
                such as `compression-method` (values: `gzip`, `lzma`, ...),
                `file-format` (values: `csv`, `hdf5`, ...), `dataset-name`
                (values: `foo`, `bar`, ...).

                For each conceptual benchmark, it is valid to have one or many
                case permutations (if you supply only "name", then there is
                necessarily a single mutation with the special property that it
                has no other tags set).

                We advise that each unique case (as defined by the complete set
                of key/value pairs) indeed corresponds to unique benchmarking
                behavior. That is, typically, all key/value pairs other than
                "name" directly correspond to input parameters to the same
                conceptual benchmark. Note however that Conbench benchmark
                result tags are not meant to store type information. Benchmark
                authors are advised to find a custom convention for mapping
                benchmark input parameters to tags.

                Currently, primitive value types (int, float, boolean) are
                accepted, but stored as strings. Keys with empty string values
                or null values are ignored. In the future, Conbench might
                disallow all non-string values.
